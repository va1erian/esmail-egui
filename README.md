# esMail

A small, fast desktop and 100% vibe-coded mail client for IMAP and SMTP, written in Rust.

- Reads and sends mail over IMAP/SMTP, with several accounts side by side.
- Renders HTML mail with [litehtml](https://github.com/litehtml/litehtml) instead of an embedded browser: no JavaScript engine, a small binary, and message HTML is sanitised before it is shown.
- Signs in with a password or, for Gmail, with Sign in with Google (OAuth2, no app password).
- On Windows, lives in the system tray, shows new-mail notifications and comes with an installer that uninstalls cleanly. A Linux build is also provided.

Prebuilt Windows and Linux binaries are attached to each
[release](https://github.com/va1erian/esmail/releases). How to sign in, where
esMail keeps its files and how to uninstall are described in
[crates/esmail/README.md](crates/esmail/README.md).

## Building

You need a stable [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs) and a C/C++ compiler,
because litehtml is compiled from source.

- **Windows:** the "Desktop development with C++" workload of the Visual Studio
  Build Tools (MSVC).
- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
  ```
  sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev
  ```

Then:

```
cargo build --release     # target/release/esmail (esmail.exe on Windows)
cargo run --release       # build and start it
cargo test --workspace    # unit tests
```

The IMAP/SMTP tests run esMail's real network code against an in-process
server. They are ignored by default; see
[crates/mail-mock-server/README.md](crates/mail-mock-server/README.md) for how
to run them.

To build the Windows installer, install [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
and run, after a release build:

```
iscc /DAppVersion=0.1.0 installer\esmail.iss
```

The result is in `dist\`. [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) and [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) describe
the design and how the code is organised.

//! `egui-litehtml-webview` -- a reusable egui widget that renders HTML/CSS
//! message bodies via [litehtml](https://github.com/litehtml/litehtml)
//! (through the `va1erian/litehtml-rs` Rust bindings).
//!
//! # Why litehtml
//!
//! No legitimate mail client executes JavaScript in HTML email, so a full
//! JS-capable browser engine is more than laying out message bodies needs.
//! litehtml is a JS-less HTML/CSS layout and rendering engine, which keeps
//! the resulting binary small.
//!
//! # Design: a render worker thread
//!
//! litehtml's parse + layout is slow on real-world newsletter HTML (several
//! seconds for some marketing mail) and fetching remote images is network
//! I/O, so **none of it runs on the UI thread**. Each [`WebView`] owns one
//! background thread (the "worker") that owns the painter engine (see
//! `painter.rs`) outright -- it is `!Send` (it holds `Rc`s), so it is created
//! *on* the worker and never crosses a thread boundary. The UI thread only
//! ever:
//!
//! * sends the worker a `Render` job after a `load`/`reload`/resize, and
//! * receives finished outputs -- display lists -- in [`WebView::show`]. The
//!   worker calls `Context::request_repaint` when it has something to show.
//!
//! Render jobs carry a monotonically increasing id. The worker drops
//! superseded render jobs from its queue and re-checks the id between
//! stages, so dragging the window edge (a job per width) or clicking through
//! messages quickly never queues up seconds of stale layout work; the UI
//! likewise ignores frames whose id is not the newest.
//!
//! # Painting with egui's own painter
//!
//! The worker lays the page out with litehtml, measuring text with egui's own
//! font stack (system fonts are found with `fontdb`, see `fonts.rs`), and
//! *records a display list* -- rects, gradient meshes, glyph runs, image quads,
//! clips. The UI thread paints that list with `egui::Painter` every frame,
//! culled to the visible region. There is no bitmap canvas, no tiling and no
//! texture upload of the page, and text is crisp at any DPI.
//!
//! # No persisted `litehtml::Document`
//!
//! `litehtml::Document<'a>` borrows its `DocumentContainer` mutably for the
//! `Document`'s own lifetime, which makes storing both as sibling fields a
//! self-referential-struct problem. The worker sidesteps that: it stores only
//! the container (which holds the fonts and decoded images, reused across
//! jobs) and builds a `Document` fresh for each pass, dropping it straight
//! after. The decoded images have no eviction API of their own, so the worker
//! drops and rebuilds the whole engine once it has decoded past its budget:
//! rare, but it keeps a long-lived view from accumulating one texture per
//! image ever shown.
//!
//! # Text selection without a `Document`
//!
//! Selecting text needs the page's text and geometry long after the
//! `Document` is gone, so the worker records them while it is alive: every
//! draw pass walks the laid-out document once and sends a [`TextRunTable`]
//! (one run per word: box, text, per-character x offsets, containing block,
//! forced line breaks) with the frame. Hit-testing, dragging, double/triple
//! click, the highlight (painted by egui over the page, never into it) and
//! the copied text are all plain geometry over that table on the UI thread,
//! so nothing re-lays-out per pointer move. A selection is two carets (run
//! index + character); it survives a re-layout of the same text (resize,
//! images arriving) and is dropped when a different page loads. Ctrl+C and
//! Ctrl+A act only while the view has egui focus, so text fields keep theirs.
//!
//! # Links without a `Document`
//!
//! Which link is under the pointer is answered the same way. The draw pass
//! also records a [`LinkTable`] (every `<a href>` with its per-line boxes and
//! the blocks and images inside it), and the UI thread resolves clicks and the
//! hand cursor by point-in-rectangle lookup: instant, with no second parse +
//! layout per click (issue #27).
//!
//! # Render sequence (one `Render` job)
//!
//! 1. **Record**: build a `Document`, `render()` it at the requested width,
//!    `draw()` it into a fresh display list.
//! 2. **Discover images**: URLs are only known after the layout has walked
//!    the document. `data:` URIs are decoded locally (litehtml has no
//!    network layer; `esmail` inlines `cid:` parts as `data:` URIs first);
//!    everything else goes to [`WebViewHandler::intercept`], several at a
//!    time. If remote images are involved, the text-only list from step 1 is
//!    sent right away so the message is readable while images arrive.
//! 3. **Record again** with the images loaded (an image can change layout, so
//!    this is a full pass from scratch), and send that list. Repeats if the
//!    redraw turns up more URLs, up to a small limit.
//!
//! # Sanitization stays the host's job
//!
//! litehtml's `email` feature includes its own `prepare_html`/
//! `prepare_email_html` pipeline with script-stripping sanitization. This
//! crate does not use it. `esmail`'s `render.rs` already runs the message
//! through `ammonia` (a dedicated, well-audited HTML sanitizer) before any
//! of this crate's code sees it, and that stays the real trust boundary --
//! defense in depth, not replaced by litehtml's own safety net, per the
//! approved migration plan.

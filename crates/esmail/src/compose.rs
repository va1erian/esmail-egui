//! Compose window state and Reply/Reply-All/Forward derivation (B7 of
//! PLAN.md). Sending itself lives in `smtp.rs`; this module only builds the
//! editable state a compose window starts from — pure and unit-tested, no
//! network or UI.
//!
//! Reply-All's Cc is every address in the original `To` field (comma-joined
//! by `imap.rs`'s envelope parsing) minus `my_address` — there is no
//! original Cc to fold in, since `MailHeader` doesn't carry one (the
//! envelope's `Cc` list is never fetched).

//! One connected account: its own [`ImapActor`] (control session + body
//! worker), its own `IDLE` watch, its own new-mail watermark and poll timer
//! -- everything `main.rs` used to hold exactly one of (issue #35).
//!
//! An [`AccountSession`] owns all of that, and dropping it tears all of it
//! down: the forwarder task is aborted, the [`idle_watch::IdleWatch`] is
//! cancelled, and once the last command sender is gone the actor exits and
//! closes its connections. That drop *is* Logout / Remove account, so no
//! per-account resource can outlive the account (the stale-`IDLE` bug the
//! single global `idle_watch_started` flag used to paper over).
//!
//! **Attribution.** [`ImapEvent`] variants carry a mailbox / uid / request id
//! but no account. Rather than touching every variant, the per-account
//! forwarding task tags whatever it forwards as `(AccountId, ImapEvent)` --
//! the UI drains one merged channel and routes on the id.
//!
//! **Isolation.** Nothing here is shared between accounts: separate
//! channels, separate watermark (a local of the forwarder task), separate
//! reconnect backoff in `imap.rs` and `idle_watch.rs`. A dead server or a
//! wrong password only ever stalls that one account's tasks.

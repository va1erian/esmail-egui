//! How background tasks tell a frontend that there is something to pump.
//!
//! Actors and forwarders push events into channels; the frontend drains them
//! on its own thread. A [`Waker`] is the only thing the core knows about that
//! thread: calling it must make the frontend run its next drain soon. Each
//! frontend builds one from its own primitive (egui's `request_repaint_of`, a
//! Win32 `PostMessage`, ...), so this module names no UI type.

//! The Windows implementation of [`super`]: a system tray icon + menu (so the
//! window can be minimized to the tray instead of exiting the process) and
//! toast notifications for new mail, called through the WinRT toast API.
//! See PLAN.md §B10.
//!
//! This file owns all the Windows glue; the decision logic it is driven by
//! (when to poll, whether an update is "new mail", what a toast should say,
//! the toast XML and click arguments) lives in `notify.rs` and is unit tested
//! there without needing any of what is in this file.

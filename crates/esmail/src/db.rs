//! Local SQLite cache: message metadata, cached bodies, and a full-text
//! index, keyed by `(account_id, mailbox, uid)`.
//!
//! B3 of PLAN.md. What's here: the relational schema (`mailboxes`,
//! `messages`, `bodies`), an LRU cap on cached bodies, and the pure
//! `sync_decision` this needs to eventually drive incremental sync. What's
//! **not** here yet: anything that actually issues the incremental IMAP
//! fetch a `FetchFrom` decision calls for — `imap.rs` reports the
//! UIDVALIDITY/UIDNEXT it already reads off `session.examine()`, `db.rs`
//! records it and computes the decision, but nothing acts on `FetchFrom` by
//! requesting more messages yet. `BulkDownload` still pulls the whole
//! mailbox every time. See PLAN.md §B3 for why that part waited.

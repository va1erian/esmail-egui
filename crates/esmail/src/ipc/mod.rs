//! A local, authenticated byte stream between esMail's two processes: the tiny
//! background listener and the GUI (see `docs/BACKGROUND-LISTENER.md`).
//!
//! Three layers, each replaceable without touching the ones above it:
//!
//! * [`Transport`] -- how two processes on one machine reach each other:
//!   `bind` a name, `accept` and `connect`. The stream it produces is just
//!   `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`. [`LocalSocket`] is the real one (a named pipe on
//!   Windows, a Unix domain socket elsewhere, both through the `interprocess`
//!   crate); [`Memory`] is an in-process one for tests. Adding an OS or a
//!   mechanism means implementing this trait, nothing else.
//! * [`Connection`] -- JSON lines over any such stream, with a bounded line
//!   length, plus the [`Server`] / [`connect`] handshake that proves the client
//!   knows a per-session token before either side says anything else.
//! * [`message`] -- what the two sides actually say to each other.
//!
//! **Who may connect.** A transport must keep other users out on its own
//! (Windows: an owner-only ACL on the pipe; Unix: a socket in a directory only
//! its owner can enter). The token is a second lock for a same-user process
//! that should not be talking to us, and the listener sends nothing until it
//! has read a valid `Hello`, so a client that merely manages to connect learns
//! nothing.

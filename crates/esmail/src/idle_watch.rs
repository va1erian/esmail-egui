//! IMAP `IDLE` (RFC 2177) push watch for new mail -- a dedicated connection
//! that sends `MailboxChanged` the moment the server pushes anything during
//! an idle wait, instead of `session.rs`'s per-account forwarder having to
//! poll on a fixed timer to find out. See PLAN.md's "IMAP push (IDLE)"
//! section for the design rationale and what B10's polling still covers.
//!
//! **Why a separate connection from `ImapActor`'s.** `async_imap::Handle`'s
//! own doc comment says it plainly: "As long as a `Handle` is active, the
//! mailbox cannot be otherwise accessed." Sharing one session between IDLE
//! and header/body fetches would mean every fetch has to interrupt IDLE
//! (send `DONE`, do the fetch, re-issue `IDLE`) around itself -- exactly the
//! control+worker session split PLAN.md §B2 called for and deferred for lack
//! of anything to verify it against. `mail-mock-server` (added since) makes
//! that verifiable now, but the *full* pool rework is still separate,
//! larger, real follow-on work; this module sidesteps needing it by keeping
//! IDLE on its own always-open connection that does nothing but idle,
//! independent of `ImapActor`'s session.
//!
//! **What a push means.** IDLE reports "something changed" without saying
//! what -- new mail, an expunge, a flag change all look the same from here.
//! This module makes no attempt to tell them apart: `MailboxChanged` just
//! means "go re-`EXAMINE`", exactly what B10's `ImapCommand::PollMailbox`
//! already does. `session.rs` wires a `MailboxChanged` the same way it wires a
//! poll-timer tick: send `PollMailbox`, let the existing watermark logic in
//! `notify.rs` decide whether it was actually new mail.

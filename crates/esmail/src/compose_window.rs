//! Compose windows: one native window per message.
//!
//! Each [`ComposeWindow`] is an egui *deferred* viewport (a real OS window
//! with its own taskbar entry, title bar and place on any monitor), drawn
//! from state it shares with the app behind an `Arc<Mutex<..>>`. Deferred
//! rather than immediate on purpose: an immediate viewport is drawn inside
//! the main window's frame, and eframe runs no frame for the main window
//! while it is minimized, hidden in the tray or covered by another window --
//! which would freeze every compose window along with it. A deferred one
//! repaints on its own.
//!
//! The window never touches the rest of the app. Its buttons set flags in the
//! shared state (`send_requested`, `finished`) and wake the main viewport,
//! whose `logic()` picks them up and issues the actual SMTP send.
//!
//! The result comes back the other way without waiting on the main window,
//! on purpose: on Windows, a window with no focus -- which, once a compose
//! window is open, includes the main window unless the user deliberately
//! clicks back onto it -- can have its already-scheduled repaints delayed by
//! Windows' background power throttling for a long time (`main.rs`'s
//! `platform::disable_background_throttling` turns this off for the whole
//! process, but that alone wasn't enough in practice to make it prompt).
//! Rather than have a successful send depend on the user going back to the
//! main window, `EsMailApp`'s SMTP forwarder task calls
//! [`ComposeWindow::mark_sent_and_hide`] / [`ComposeWindow::set_error_and_wake`]
//! *directly* from its own background thread, using the copy of this window
//! kept in `EsMailApp::compose_registry` for exactly this. Those hide the OS
//! window (or show the error) on this window's own next pass -- independent
//! of the main window, and normally immediate, since this is the window the
//! Send click just landed in. The main window's `logic()` still does the
//! bookkeeping (dropping the entry from `EsMailApp::compose_windows`, which
//! is what actually destroys the OS window: egui destroys a deferred
//! viewport the parent stops showing) whenever it next runs, since that part
//! isn't user-visible and so doesn't need to be prompt.

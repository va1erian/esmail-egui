//! The frontend-agnostic application core (issue #108): the state behind the
//! folder pane, message list and reading pane, and the logic that keeps it in
//! step with what the accounts' IMAP sessions report.
//!
//! An [`AppCore`] knows no UI type. It is built with a [`Waker`] (how a
//! session tells the frontend there is something to pump) and a tokio
//! [`Handle`] (where actors run, so a frontend need not own the runtime). The
//! frontend calls [`AppCore::pump`] when woken, redraws from the public state,
//! and applies the returned [`Changes`].

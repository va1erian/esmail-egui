//! Progress reporting for middle-to-long operations (issue #79).
//!
//! An operation qualifies as "middle-to-long" if it either makes more than
//! one network/disk round trip (a bulk flag/move over a selection, indexing a
//! mailbox) or is a single step whose duration scales with the user's data
//! (an SMTP send, a message export, an attachment's disk write). A single
//! round trip for one message does not qualify on its own.
//!
//! The app tracks **one** such operation at a time: a new report replaces
//! whatever the previous one was, and the UI disables starting a second bulk
//! action while one is in flight. A report names its [`ProgressKind`] -- the
//! UI turns that into the label -- and is either counted (a loop over items,
//! drawn as a bar) or indeterminate (a single step with no natural count,
//! drawn as a spinner). There is deliberately no cancellation support.

/// What an in-flight operation is doing. A closed enum rather than free-form
/// text so the protocol modules (`imap.rs`, `smtp.rs`) never invent user-facing
/// copy -- that stays in `main.rs`'s rendering.

//! An in-process IMAP + SMTP server for testing esmail without a real
//! mailbox provider. See `crates/esmail/tests/imap_smtp_integration.rs` for
//! how it's driven, and this crate's `README.md` for the design rationale
//! (why a hand-rolled server rather than a real one like GreenMail, and why
//! TLS trust is handled the way it is).

//! One window per data directory: a second launch hands over to the first.
//!
//! The lock is `esmail::shell`'s, the same one the egui frontend takes, so the
//! two frontends cannot run over one cache either. A second launch leaves its
//! request in files (`show.request`, and `compose.request` for `--compose`) and
//! signals a named event; the first instance has a thread blocked on that event
//! and forwards what it finds to the window. Nothing polls, so a window hidden
//! in the tray costs no wakeups.

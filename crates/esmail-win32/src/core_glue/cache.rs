//! The local mail cache, seen from a window: what it holds is shown before the
//! network answers, what the network reports is written back to it, and
//! searches run against it.
//!
//! Reads go through a read-only connection on the runtime's blocking pool, so
//! they neither wait for the cache actor's queue nor touch the UI thread.
//! Writes and searches are commands to a [`DbActor`]; its replies, and the
//! reads' results, come back as [`CacheEvent`]s that [`Cache::pump`] moves out
//! of a channel without blocking, exactly like the IMAP events.

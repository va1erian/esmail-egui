//! Which messages are on their way out, and what each SMTP outcome asks for.
//!
//! A send is attempted straight away. When it fails, the message is recorded in
//! the outbox table so it is retried later (by this app or the egui one) and is
//! not lost with its window; when it succeeds, the outbox row and the draft it
//! may have left behind are done. This type keeps the bookkeeping that ties the
//! three together and stays free of any I/O, so the decisions are unit tested.
